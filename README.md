# Employee-DB
## Challenge 9 
- Data Modeling: inspected the 6 CSVs and sketch the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) using QuickDBD
- Data Engineering: Data types, primary keys, foreign keys, composite keys are properly specified. CSV files are correctly imported to each corresponding table. Note: accurately defined value length (slightly more generous) for columns.
- Data Analysis: each question is answered and information is properly addressed.
- For submission, I included the table schemata and queries for data analysis in the same .sql file.
-This is a revision!
